# Guestbook dApp

## 📌 Project Description

The Guestbook dApp is a decentralized application built using the **Clarity** smart contract language on the **Stacks blockchain**. It allows users to leave a short message — similar to signing a digital guestbook — which is then tied to their wallet address and stored immutably on-chain.

## 🌍 Project Vision

This project demonstrates how users can interact with decentralized applications on Stacks. The focus is on simplicity, clarity, and utility, making it a great foundational example for more advanced Web3 social or messaging dApps.
