# Guestbook dApp

## 📌 Project Description

The Guestbook dApp is a simple smart contract built using the Clarity language on the Stacks blockchain. It allows users to leave a short message (like signing a digital guestbook) and retrieve it later. Each user's message is uniquely tied to their wallet address.

## 🌍 Project Vision

The goal of this dApp is to demonstrate how users can interact with decentralized applications on the Stacks blockchain. It focuses on simplicity, clarity, and utility — offering a foundation for more advanced social or messaging features in Web3.

## 🚀 Future Scope

- Add timestamps for messages  
- Enable editing or deleting messages  
- Create a front-end using React + Hiro Wallet  
- Public feed showing all user messages  
- Limit rate of messages per user to avoid spam
